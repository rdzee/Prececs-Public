## About This Project
Cervical cancer is one of the fourth most common types of cancer that occurs in women worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020. Early detection plays an important role in the prevention of this type of cancer. One such early detection method is through colposcopy image analysis which is a medical procedure to examine the cervix. This procedure will obtain an image of the cervix which will then be analyzed based on color changes, after the Acetic Acid Visual Inspection (VIA) process. However, the analysis requires experienced and specialized medical personnel. To overcome this, a system is needed for automatic detection of cervical cancer image classification. Therefore, researchers propose the design and development of an Android mobile application to be able to detect early cervical cancer through using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.

In building the application, researchers propose six stages of research. The first stage is a literature study that aims to identify and obtain information. Next, researchers will process data from colposcopic images of IVA results including data addition, image pre-processing, and data division. The data will be used for CNN Model Design and Development. The CNN model will then be tested using test data to determine its performance. After obtaining good performance, the model will be integrated with the Android application. Finally, the Android app will be tested to determine the performance of the model in the app.

The results showed good performance of the CNN model with 100% accuracy on training data, 89% on validation data, and 86% on test data. The model can be implemented well in Android mobile applications without any decrease in performance. The Android mobile application built can run well without any bugs or crashes. The application is able to assist in the pre-screening stage of cervical cancer using colposcopy images.
